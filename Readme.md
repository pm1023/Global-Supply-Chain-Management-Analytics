[![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1gnmRMrJvrHo4xPvNYJd4e6CDEL9Q3zQp?usp=sharing)

Overview

Global Supply Chain Management Analytics is a professional, end-to-end data analytics project that turns transaction-level global trade and logistics data into actionable insights. Built for clarity, reproducibility, and impact, this project demonstrates modern data engineering, EDA, visualization, and modeling techniques using Python (Google Colab / Jupyter).

Why this project

- Helps business leaders and data teams make informed decisions about sourcing, logistics, and costs.
- Shows a complete workflow from raw data to business recommendations and interactive visualizations.
- Suitable as a portfolio piece for data scientists, analysts, and supply chain professionals.

Highlights

- Clean, modular notebooks for data ingestion, cleaning, feature engineering, and visualization.
- Clear storytelling: metrics, KPIs, and slide-ready charts.
- Reproducible environment (requirements.txt / Colab-ready notebooks).
- Optional advanced modules: forecasting (scikit-learn), interactive dashboards (Plotly / Dash), and deployment notes.

Key Objectives

1. Perform robust Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to reveal patterns in trade, cost, and delivery performance.
2. Identify cost drivers, shipping inefficiencies, and high-risk suppliers.
3. Build visual narratives and dashboards to communicate findings to stakeholders.
4. Provide reproducible code and guidance for extending the project into forecasting and optimization.

Dataset Overview

- Type: Transaction-level global trade and logistics dataset (CSV / Excel).
- Features (typical): Country / Region, Supplier / Manufacturer, Product / Category, Shipment Date, Delivery Time, Cost / Freight Charges, Demand / Order Quantity, Lead Time, Mode of Transport, Incoterms.
- Time period: Multi-year (varies by dataset)
- Source: Internal / simulated data provided for analysis. Replace with real data as needed.

Analytical Workflow (What you'll find)

1. Data Ingestion & Validation
   - Load CSV/Excel with pandas, validate schema, automated sanity checks, and sample review.
2. Data Cleaning & Transformation
   - Impute and handle missing values, normalize currencies/dates, remove duplicates, and correct types.
3. Feature Engineering
   - Compute lead_time, cost_per_unit, route_distance (if available), on_time_delivery_flag, seasonality features, and rolling aggregates.
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - Univariate and multivariate analysis, outlier detection, distribution plots, correlation heatmaps, and KPI tables.
5. Visualization & Storytelling
   - Time series trends, supplier ranking dashboards, route/country performance maps, and category breakdowns with Matplotlib/Seaborn and optional Plotly interactivity.
6. Insights & Recommendations
   - Business-first summaries with quantitative KPIs, supplier risk lists, and prioritized recommendations for cost, time, and operational improvements.
7. Optional Advanced Analysis
   - Predictive models for demand forecasting or delay prediction (scikit-learn), clustering for supplier segmentation, and what-if scenario simulation.

Representative Results (Concise)

- Cost Optimization: Identified the top suppliers responsible for most cost overruns and quantified a potential 15–25% saving via vendor consolidation and route optimization.
- Time Efficiency: Found that regional warehousing reduced average lead times by X% (replace X with your results) and highlighted Q3 seasonal peaks in delivery delays.
- Operational Efficiency: Detected a strong correlation between lead time and freight cost, and discovered that electronics categories show the highest shipping volatility.

KPIs & Dashboards

- Core KPIs: Total Freight Cost, Freight Cost / Unit, Average Lead Time, On-time Delivery Rate, Supplier Cost Contribution, Inventory Days of Supply.
- Dashboard suggestions: Interactive supplier leaderboard, regional traffic/time series, and a cost-driver decomposition view.

Project Structure

- notebooks/                # Colab/Jupyter notebooks for each analysis stage
- data/                     # Sample datasets and data dictionary (do NOT commit sensitive data)
- src/                      # Reusable preprocessing and feature-engineering modules
- reports/                  # Exported charts, PDF summaries, and slide decks
- requirements.txt          # Python dependencies
- README.md                 # This file

How to run (Colab / Local)

Colab (recommended):
1. Open the provided Google Colab notebook badge link and upload your dataset or connect to Google Drive.
2. Run cells in order; the notebook includes checkpoints and sample outputs.

Local environment:
1. Create a virtualenv and install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Place dataset CSVs in data/ and run notebooks or src scripts.

Reproducibility & Testing

- Notebooks include deterministic seeds for modeling and a data validation notebook for schema checks.
- Unit tests for critical preprocessing functions are located in tests/ (if present).

Suggested Extensions

- Integrate a Power BI / Tableau data source or build a Plotly Dash app for stakeholder-facing dashboards.
- Add probabilistic forecasting (Prophet or deep learning) for demand or delay risk predictions.
- Build automated data pipelines using Airflow or Prefect for scheduled refresh and alerts.

This repository is crafted to showcase how data-driven analytics can materially improve global supply chain decisions. Replace sample numbers and simulated insights with your dataset outputs to build a production-ready analytics product<img width="615" height="3336" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/26669d47-2d07-4bad-a56c-f94200e65543" />


From a Technical Perspective:

Data preprocessing and EDA pipelines can be modularized for automation.

Integration with Power BI / Tableau can enhance real-time visualization.

Predictive analytics (e.g., demand forecasting or delay prediction) can extend this project.
