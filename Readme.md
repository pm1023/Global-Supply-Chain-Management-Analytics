📌 Project Overview

This project explores Global Supply Chain Management (SCM) data to analyze trade performance, logistics efficiency, and operational trends using data-driven insights.
It was developed in Google Colab and focuses on transforming real-world supply chain data into actionable intelligence — demonstrating end-to-end data analysis, visualization, and interpretation skills.

The goal is to help both business leaders and technical teams understand the patterns, bottlenecks, and opportunities within global trade and logistics.

🎯 Objectives

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify key patterns in global supply chain operations.

Analyze factors influencing costs, delivery timelines, and supplier performance.

Visualize trends across countries, categories, and time to support strategic decision-making.

Build a clear, reproducible data analytics workflow showcasing professional data storytelling.

📈 Key Results & Insights

🔹 Cost Optimization

Identified top 10 suppliers contributing to highest cost overruns.

Proposed a 15–20% potential saving via vendor reallocation.

🔹 Time Efficiency

Average delivery time improved when regional warehouses were used for intermediate storage.

Seasonal demand spikes observed during Q3 each year.

🔹 Operational Efficiency

Strong positive correlation between lead time and freight cost, indicating delayed logistics in longer routes.

Category-level insights show electronics had the highest shipping volatility.

💡 Business & Technical Insights

From a Business Perspective:

Enhance supply chain visibility through KPI dashboards.

Prioritize local sourcing to reduce transport time and cost.

Implement data-driven supplier evaluation for better procurement strategy.

From a Technical Perspective:

Data preprocessing and EDA pipelines can be modularized for automation.

Integration with Power BI / Tableau can enhance real-time visualization.

Predictive analytics (e.g., demand forecasting or delay prediction) can extend this project.
